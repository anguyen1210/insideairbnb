The repo contains two main scripts that extract specified files from the Inside Airbnb website, saves them locally, and then uploads them to a local SQLITE database which can be used for subsequent analysis. Useful functions are included in the 'tools' files, as well as functions that can be used to generate automatic email alerts.  

Note: At present, the local database name is hard-coded into the scripts. Similarly, the email alert script needs to be modified to include the relevant sender/receiver details.
